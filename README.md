# MavenMarket_Report
##    Summary
###       This project is a 3 page report on a fictitious mulit-national grocery store named Maven Market. The dataset was found on https://www.mavenanalytics.io/. This project showcases my ability to create reports and dashboards that are easy to read but can offer excellent insights and help a manager make data-driven decisions. The first page of the report shows an overall view of the company, the second page allows the user to look through data on each brand and their products and the third page allows the user to toggle through each region as well as each store in that region.
